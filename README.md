# Personal-Projects
Collection of work done in my free time outside of either work or school.

The Finance Tracker is funtional, with a refresh button, though thats in addition to my plans to add another macro that will trigger on opening the file itself. I also have plans to add more visualizations of the available data, and other dashboard utilities.

The Nixos build is just my current configuration files, representing abilities in nix and lua. Further details on the build can be found in the README located in that folder.
