# Personal-Projects
Collection of work done in my free time outside of either work or school.

The Finance Tracker is funtional, with a refresh button, though thats in addition to my plans to add another macro that will trigger on opening the file itself. I also have plans to add more visualizations of the available data, and other dashboard utilities.

Currently, my largest project is not currently represented in this portfolio. I'm creating a homelab environment with a multi-purpose server, all based on NixOS and primarily utilizing open source software. 
I have a couple machines still in the process of getting initial configs completed and there will soon be those related files uploaded onto this repository. Complete with READMEs explaining the system architecture, and network solutions.
