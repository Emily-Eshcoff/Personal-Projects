As stated in the README from the previous directory, this project is functional, with plans to further expand functions and utilities. With likely further macro integration, dashboard utilities, and data visualization.

The refresh button will update all data dependent on current stock price data. With plans for another macro that will run upon initially opening the file.

Ive also seperated individual stocks from ETPs, since those markets have such a large differential on volatily. I also plan to add another section representing a selection of Mutual Funds, and Bonds.
